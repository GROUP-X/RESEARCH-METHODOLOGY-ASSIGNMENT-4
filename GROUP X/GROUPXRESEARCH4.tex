\section{INTRODUCTION}
\subsection{BACKGROUND}
\paragraph{•}
    Currently, people go through brokers to be able to get houses to rent of which these broker include extra amounts to carter for their house searching services of which most at times exaggerate these amounts making the whole process extremely costly.  
\paragraph{•}
   Another problem people have faced in the past has been an issue of lack of privacy, they pay these brokers to get them rental house and when they get the space, the biggest percentage have complained that this wasn’t the kind they expected and that there is a lot of openness at the location. All this was because they couldn’t move around with the brokers to choose their preference ending up in disappointments.
\paragraph{•}
  More to this issue the tenant was unable to know the condition of the house and therefore they ended up getting poor conditioned houses and they ended up suffering with many health complications that they contracted from these poor conditioned rentals.
\paragraph{•}
Seeing all these problems, our team came up with an IT based solution to help tenants to acquire rental space in a smart, convenient and secure way to eliminate all that. The Online land lord-Tenant system will provide tenants with an easy to access system with a database of lots of houses to suit any tenant’s requirements. These tenants will be able to locate any kind of house in any location of their choice  and in the end of it all we will b ensuring that both the tenant’s needs of a comfortable rental and the land lord’s needs of acquiring customers are met hence beating two birds with the same stne
